#     - Given an array of integers nums add up all the integers in the array. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

#     - input: nums = [1,3,4,5]
#     - output: 13
# - example2:

#     - output: 1

# or we could just have the file system be straight java?
# need to also have all arrays be comma separated and with spaces ex: [1, 2, 3] (not the spaces)
